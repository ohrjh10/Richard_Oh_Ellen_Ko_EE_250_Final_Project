Instructions:
The weather_rpi_code.py file must be loaded onto the rpi, and the first variable on the client.connect line must be set to the ip address of the rpi. From there, run the weather_vm_code.py on the vm before running the file on the rpi. Each value being sent to the vm will also print in the terminal. Once the values have stopped printing in the terminal, that means the csv file has been populated. Put the csv file in the same location that the train.ipynb file is located, and open that folder using jupyter notebook. Then, the code in the train.ipynb file can be run and the classification graph shown.
